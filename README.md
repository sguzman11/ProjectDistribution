Libertas College Prep.

I am a full time student, with a full time job at Libertas College Prep, which means there is so much to get done during the day. When I first heard there was a project to work on a website, I thought about updating and managing my job’s website. 
This project shows the progress of the website I manage for my job.


 

The CSS style of this page is very direct. Our principle believes in discipline, directness and responsibility, thus I have used navy blue, yellow and grey (the colors of our school) as key elements throughtout the page.  


The style  again is very straightforward, it doesn’t include much of a wow power, because our principle doesn’t want to deviate the purpose Libertas College Prep has for our students. 

A couple of services I have integrated on this site, is the availability to make donations and fill out forms. As a school there are a lot of interesting events taking place. First of all  an external  service as Paypal was just installed and gone live in the libertas site.   


For this part of the site, I have managed to have a couple of pictures with actual staff and students, makng it more believable to the spectator.  At first I thought about adding my own button to link it to the paypal page, however my boss said she preferred the normal button. In the sense of limitations I had to stick with the procedure and this is where a user is directed when clicked on:   



In addition to these improvements, I was also able to add a form for lottery purposes. As a new charter, it is procedure to have lottery forms available for the public, with specific dates as to how and when it will take place, this is how ours currently looks.   


This form has been updated to have both an online and printable version as well. We try to have parents feel comfortable with the school’s website.

Our responses to these forms can be downloaded to an excel sheet like this one: 
 


In mind and towards completing this project I am planning to continue to organize and implement more information to this website,  as we continue to grow I plan to continue to update this website with more pictures and more information about what our school offers. Right now I am in the mist of completing another project approval to have it live within some time.  

I also intend to have a friendly tab for students, and a parent portal so they can look into all the applications we utilize at school for behavior purposes and to make it easier for them to check  on a daily basis.
